The result of this close collaboration between the scientific, business and arts community opens up new possibilities for strong multi-disciplinary education and research, which is imperative for creating radical solutions to existing modern technological problems. The Finnish government, in 2010, set out to create a university that has innovation built into its foundations, merging three institutions into one along the way, forming an entity that serves as Finland's model for an innovation university.It comprises six schools with over 19,000 students and 5,000 staff members, thus being Finland's third-largest university. The six schools of Aalto University are all renowned institutions in their respective fields. The main campus of Aalto University is located in Otaniemi, Espoo, where the engineering schools operate, with two schools currently headquartered in Helsinki: the School of Business in Töölö and the School of Arts, Design and Architecture in Arabianranta (set to be relocated to Otaniemi in 2016).

Originally founded in 1850, Antioch has long been an agent of disruptive change, having been the only liberal arts college in the country with a required work component for more than 100 years. The cooperative education program reflects Antioch’s critical pedagogical insight that the separation of classroom learning from the world of work is artificial—a philosophy that has produced Nobel Laureates, Fulbright and Rhodes scholars, and notables in the arts, government, business and education. The words of Loren Pope, former education editor of the The New York Times and author of Colleges That Change Lives, speak to Antioch’s unique capability: Antioch is in a class by itself. There is no college or university in the country that makes a more profound difference in a young person’s life, or that creates more effective adults.

Until Clark instituted undergraduate programs in 1902, the University offered only Ph.D.-granting programs. Clark is also one of the oldest universities in the United States to offer formal graduate programs, second only to Johns Hopkins University. Clark University’s mission is to educate undergraduate and graduate students to be imaginative and contributing citizens of the world, and to advance the frontiers of knowledge and understanding through rigorous scholarship and creative effort. The University seeks to prepare students to meet the challenges of a complex and rapidly changing society. In students and faculty, Clark fosters a commitment to excellence in studying traditional academic disciplines, as well as innovation in exploring questions that cross disciplinary boundaries. The free pursuit of inquiry and the free exchange of ideas are central to that commitment. The focus of Clark's academic program is a liberal-arts education enriched by interactions among undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty, and is closely linked to a select number of professional programs. Clark also serves students who wish to continue formal education throughout their lives. The intellectual and personal growth of students is enhanced by a wide variety of educational programs and extracurricular activities. Clark believes that intellectual growth must be accompanied by the development of values, the cultivation of responsible independence, and the appreciation of a range of perspectives. Clark's academic community has long been distinguished by the pursuit of scientific inquiry and humanistic studies, enlivened by a concern for significant social issues. Among many other scholarly endeavors, Clark contributes to understanding human development, assessing relationships between people and the environment, and managing risk in a technological society. Clark is dedicated to being a dynamic community of learners able to thrive in today’s increasingly interrelated societies. The University maintains a national and international character, attracting high-caliber students and faculty from all quarters of the globe.

The establishment of Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIMA) was the outcome of one such innovative initiative.Led by Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, Shri. Kasturbhai Lalbhai and proactively supported by the then Chief Minister of Gujarat, Dr. Jivraj Mehta, a group of enlightened individuals set up IIMA. This group ably wove together a coalition of five actors - the governments at the centre and the state, the local industrialists, the Ford Foundation and the Harvard Business School, in a true spirit of public private partnership to establish the Institute. The constitution for governance of IIMA was different from that for traditional universities. It was set up as an institution that would be managed by a Society, the IIMA Society, created under the Societies Act, for the purpose. The Institute was to be run by the Board of Governors, constituted by the IIMA Society; the Board would have wide representation from all the relevant constituencies to reflect the multifarious needs of a developing nation. IIMA was therefore conceived as an Institute that would be a Board managed institution, free from exclusive control of any one constituency. Thus, operational freedom is an integral part of the DNA of IIMA.","http://public.crunchbase.com/t_api_images/v1428126125/rrmmyxl82cem8vgayjvv.png","http://www.iimahd.ernet.in/",2014-04-20,2016-01-24,"India","Ahmedabad",23.02579,23.02579

It was set up as a not-for-profit public private partnership (N-PPP) and is the first IIIT to be set up (under this model) in India. The Government of Andhra Pradesh lent support to the institute by grant of land and buildings. A Governing Council consisting of eminent people from academia, industry and government presides over the governance of the institution.IIIT-H was set up as a research university focused on the core areas of Information Technology, such as Computer Science, Electronics and Communications, and their applications in other domains. The institute evolved strong research programmes in a host of areas, with computation or IT providing the connecting thread, and with an emphasis on the development of technology and applications, which can be transferred for use to industry and society. This required carrying out basic research that can be used to solve real life problems. As a result, a synergistic relationship has come to exist at the Institute between basic and applied research. Faculty carries out a number of academic industrial projects, and a few companies have been incubated based on the research done at the Institute.IIIT-H is organized as research centres and labs, instead of the conventional departments, to facilitate inter-disciplinary research and a seamless flow of knowledge within the Institute. Faculty assigned to the centers and labs conduct research, as well as academic programs, which are owned by the Institute, and not by individual research centers.The Institute combines pioneering research with top class education. An innovative curriculum allows the student flexibility in selecting courses and projects. Students, even at the undergraduate level, get to participate in ongoing research and technology development - an opportunity unprecedented in India. As a result, a vibrant undergraduate programme co-exists with a strong postgraduate programme.Recognizing that the goal of education is to develop a broad and humanistic outlook among students (and beyond), the Institute runs a unique human values programme at the undergraduate level. Regular faculty conducts the programme. Also, elements of the programme are made available to IIIT-H’s postgraduate students, faculty and students at other universities and colleges, and any interested individual or organization.In sum, the Institute offers students a unique environment that promotes culture, sports, societal contributions, art, self-governance and human values.It is also at the forefront of research that has the potential to make a major social impact.","http://public.crunchbase.com/t_api_images/v1437473012/cyaawnhdsff7yayq8y70.png","http://www.iiit.ac.in/",2014-04-20,2015-12-23,"India","Hyderabad",17.38405,17.38405

"istanbul-university","Istanbul University","Istanbul University is a prominent Turkish university located in Istanbul.","Istanbul University was established in 1453 by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II. However, Richard Honig, a German law historian, who claims that Byzantine and Ottoman traditions could be analyzed together, expressed that the history of Istanbul University can be traced back to March 1, 1321. The university, which was first established in today's main building, was equivalent to Roman universities consisting of schools of medicine, law, philosophy and letters, and is considered to be the pioneer of university education in Istanbul.It was founded as an institution of higher education named the Darülfünûn (House of Multiple Sciences) on July 23, 1846; but the Medrese (Islamic theological school) which was founded immediately after Mehmed II conquered Constantinople (Istanbul) in 1453 is regarded as the precursor to the Darülfünûn which evolved into Istanbul University in 1933. Education in a number of sciences and fields (such as medicine, mathematics, astronomy, cartography, geography, history, philosophy, religion, literature, philology, law, etc.) became available, and, until the 19th century, they were instrumental in educating the ruling cadres of the Ottoman society. However, when the medreses were no longer able to meet the needs of the modern world, a restructuring process began, and as a result, the institutions of higher education called Darülfünûn, the core of Istanbul University, was established.An institution of higher education named the Darülfünûn-u Osmanî (Ottoman House of Sciences) was created in 1863, but suppressed in 1871. Its first rector was Hasan Tahsini, regarded as one of the most important Ottoman scholars of the 19th century. In 1874 the Imperial University (Darülfünûn-u Sultanî) started classes in law in French, but was closed in 1881.The Imperial University, now known as Darülfünûn-u Şahâne was refounded in 1900, with the departments of theology, arts, mathematics, science and philology. In 1924, the faculties of law, medicine, arts and sciences were established in Istanbul University (İstanbul Darülfünûnu), as the university was now called. Islamic theology was added in 1925, but in 1933 the university was reorganized without the latter.The first modern Applied Physics courses were given at the Darülfünûn on 31 December 1863, which marked the beginning of a new period, and on 20 February 1870, the school was renamed as the Darülfünûn-u Osmanî (Ottoman House of Multiple Sciences) and reorganized to meet the needs of modern sciences and technologies. Starting from 1874, some classes of Literature, Law and Applied Sciences were given at the building of Galatasaray High School, which continued regularly until 1881. On 1 September 1900, the school was renamed and reorganized as the Darülfünûn-u Şahâne (Imperial House of Multiple Sciences) with courses on Mathematics, Literature and Theology. On 20 April 1912, the school was renamed as the İstanbul Darülfünûnu (Istanbul House of Multiple Sciences) while the number of courses were increased and the curricula were modernized with the establishment of the Schools of Medicine, Law, Applied Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics), Literature and Theology.On 21 April 1924, the Republic of Turkey recognized the İstanbul Darülfünûnu as a state school, and on 7 October 1925, the administrative autonomy of İstanbul Darülfünûnu was recognized while the Schools (within the old Medrese system) became modern Faculties.On 1 August 1933, İstanbul Darülfünûnu was reorganized as İstanbul Üniversitesi (Istanbul University) following the educational reforms of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Classes officially began on 1 November 1933.The university has seventeen faculties on five campuses; the main campus being on Beyazıt Square, which was originally built by Constantine the Great as the Forum Tauri and was later enlarged by Theodosius the Great as the Forum of Theodosius during the Roman period.The main campus building with its landmark gate was previously used as the headquarters of the Harbiye Nezareti (Ministry of War) by the Ottoman government. Located on the grounds is the Beyazıt Tower, a 85 m (279 ft) tall fire-watch tower. The grounds were previously the location of the Ottoman era Eski Saray (Old Palace). Some Roman and Byzantine ruins are still visible on the grounds.The university has a teaching staff of 2,000 professors and associates and 4,000 assistants and younger staff. More than 60,000 undergraduate and 8,000 postgraduate students follow the courses offered by Istanbul University every year.The main gate was depicted on the reverse of the Turkish 500 lira banknotes of 1971–1984.","http://public.crunchbase.com/t_api_images/v1406830376/vgxhnfztrswmg3bzc1y4.png","http://www.istanbul.edu.tr",2014-04-20,2016-01-21,"Turkey","Istanbul",14.34031,14.34031

We’re a private institution with a public conscience, a residential campus with global reach. Students and faculty throughout all three of Lewis & Clark’s schools—the College of Arts and Sciences, the Graduate School of Education and Counseling, and the Law School—pursue new ways of knowing by combining classic liberal learning with pioneering collaboration. Our students represent the next generation of global thinkers and leaders, unafraid to discard conventional thinking, civic complacency, and outmoded preconceptions. Yet they value what Lewis & Clark offers: an education built from the time-tested elements of careful study, original research, and spirited debate.So what makes the experience of our students unique? How about the inspiring beauty of our natural setting, on 137 wooded acres in Portland’s southwest hills. Or our rich history and our diverse, multicultural present. Or our commitment to interdisciplinary academic learning, as well as community engagement here in Portland and around the world.Add to this our well-stocked libraries, award-winning green buildings, and outstanding athletic facilities; our implementation of technology and the innovative research it allows; and above all our committed and engaged students, teachers, mentors, staff, alumni, donors, and friends.

It began as an external degree granting law school and is now the oldest continuously operating degree-granting online law school in the country offering online correspondence-based distance education. Its programs were developed so that economic obstacles, family commitments, remoteness of location, and other hardships would not prevent deserving individuals from studying law.The School currently has approximately 700 enrolled students, and over the last thirty-one years of the School's history, a large number of its graduates have gone on to successfully practice law. Graduates of the school have transitioned to jobs as private practice lawyers and litigators, deputy public defenders, deputy district attorneys, administrative court judge, and staff attorneys working for private corporations, organizations and governmental agencies.NWCULaw has a proven record of success for online law schools and distance learning, and was the first such school to offer Internet based instruction to its students by means of videoconferencing technology. It offers entirely online correspondence programs leading to the presentation of the Bachelor of Science in Law (B.S.L.) and Juris Doctor (J.D.) degrees. Students who successfully complete two years of the four-year law study program are eligible for conferment of the B.S.L. degree. Those who continue on to successfully complete the entire program are eligible for conferment of the J.D. degree.The School's high quality, very affordable online programs are offered over the Internet through a course management system and technology platform featuring Online Discussion Boards, Online Audio/Video Lectures and a Virtual Classroom to provide dynamic collaboration and communication between students and faculty members.The faculty consists of law professors who are available to all students for course-specific questions, discussions and reviews via the School's Online Discussion Boards and through Cyber-Mail. Students have access to an electronic law library, through LexisNexis, and can network with the professors and each other, and participate in online \"real-time\" chats, through the online law school's Internet campus. The School's faculty members conduct instructional sessions with students over the Internet by means of online Text Chat and modern interactive Videoconferencing technology.The law study program at Northwestern California University is environmentally progressive at a time when being GREEN is increasingly important. The innovative eco-friendly feature of the NWCULaw program is that the School's faculty members and students do not travel to meet with one another. Instead they meet \"virtually\" on their computers at specified times for discussions of study materials, to see and hear pre-recorded lectures, and to download coursework. The savings in energy and facility resources that result are good for the School, its students and the environment.","http://public.crunchbase.com/t_api_images/v1408747506/ljdysgrmwnbjwhagzyob.png","http://www.nwculaw.edu",2014-04-20,2016-01-19,"United States","Sacramento",38.58157,38.58157

When the first students assembled for class on December 14, 1891, no buildings, books or curriculum existed. Since its beginning as a land-grant institution, OSU has held true to the land-grant mission of instruction, extension and research.In 1894, two and one-half years after classes began in local churches, 144 students moved into the first academic building, later named Old Central, which is still located on the southeast corner of campus and today houses the OSU Honors College. In 1896, Oklahoma A&M held its first commencement with six male graduates.On July 1, 1957, Oklahoma A&M College became Oklahoma State University. Technical branches were established in Okmulgee in 1946 and in Oklahoma City in 1961. In 1990 these two technical branches were renamed OSU-Okmulgee and OSU-Oklahoma City; and in 2008 OSU-Okmulgee was renamed OSU Institute of Technology. OSU-Tulsa was formed in 1999 from a consortium of universities that were originally established in 1982. In July of 1988, the Oklahoma College of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery (in Tulsa) became the College of Osteopathic Medicine of OSU. In 2001, it became part of the OSU Center for Health Sciences, which also has an affiliation with its primary teaching hospital, the OSU Medical Center.OSU is located in Stillwater, a north-central Oklahoma community with a population of around 50,000. Stillwater is approximately 60 miles from the Tulsa and Oklahoma City metropolitan areas and is readily accessible from other major population centers by interstate highway and air.This coeducational University has an enrollment of more than 36,000 students on five campuses. It offers bachelor's, master's and doctor's degrees in a large number of fields, as well as the professional Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine and Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degrees. Specialist in Education degrees are also offered in selected fields.Although OSU is a large, comprehensive university, its size does not minimize the personal attention given to each student. The individual is more than just a number at this university. OSU encourages all students, when they first enroll, to identify the college in which they wish to major. Once the student has identified his or her major department, he or she becomes a very important individual to the faculty and advisers of that department. Because the average number of students majoring in any one department is less than 150, the student can count on personal attention in a friendly environment.As a comprehensive land-grant institution, OSU offers students many distinct advantages. It has nearly four million volumes in the library’s collection, modern research laboratories and equipment, excellent physical education, recreation and student union facilities, nearly 500 student organizations, nationally-recognized residence hall programs, outstanding cultural events, and nearly 40 nationally-affiliated fraternities and sororities that provide a stimulating educational and social environment.","http://public.crunchbase.com/t_api_images/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Oklahoma_State_University_Logo.svg/225px-Oklahoma_State_University_Logo.svg.png","http://go.okstate.edu/",2014-04-20,2016-01-20,"United States","Stillwater",41.72139,41.72139

The RCA has a strong research culture – there are over 120 MPhil and PhD students – that both leads and informs each School-wide knowledge base. Within each curriculum are opportunities for cross-pollination through group projects with other RCA programmes, and creative collaborations with key partners provide industry-specific experience that is mutually beneficial.Many new developments are currently in progress at the College, including the completion of new buildings, workshops and studios; the creation of a new research hub; the expansion of joint projects with industry; the launch of four dynamic new courses; and the appointment of many new members of our academic teams. Our vision is to help develop great creative minds, and ideas that will be central to the cultural evolution of our societies.Housed over two campuses in Kensington and Battersea, the RCA is surrounded by some of the most important spaces and events in London’s art and design worlds, and an exciting social scene of bars, clubs and cafés.The twenty-first-century RCA knows that its graduates contribute significant, real-world innovations across art, communication, critical writing, exhibition-making and design – both as practitioners and through research.

Swedish industry and commerce were quick to recognize the importance of specialized education in business practices, and the Stockholm School of Economics Association was thus formed in 1906 for the express purpose of establishing a School of Business in Stockholm based on the model of schools established in North America and elsewhere in Europe. Three years later (in 1909) the Stockholm School of Economics opened its doors to its first 110 students. This was possible thanks to the involvement of influential business leaders (K.A. Wallenberg, Olof A. Söderberg and Joseph Nachmanson among others), support from the City of Stockholm, government funding and donations from private endowments. The original course of study was for two years. The School was located on Brunkebergstorg in central Stockholm in a commercial building known as Brunkebergs hotell.In time, SSE outgrew these premises and in 1926 the School moved into newly constructed quarters at Sveavägen 65, the address of our main building to this day. This monumental Neo-Classical building was designed by Swedish architect Ivar Tengbom. Today the building is flanked by newer buildings and a number of additional premises are located in nearby blocks.","http://public.crunchbase.com/t_api_images/v1428743472/xrpuzdyn0v5czvccuwtl.png",NA,2013-04-20,2016-01-16,"Sweden","Stockholm",59.33258,59.33258

"texas-tech-university","Texas Tech University","Texas Tech University was created by legislative action in 1923.","Texas Tech University was created by legislative action in 1923 and has the distinction of being the largest comprehensive higher education institution in the western two-thirds of the state of Texas.  The university is the major institution of higher education in a region larger than 46 of the nation’s 50 states and is the only campus in Texas that is home to a major university, law school and medical school. Originally named Texas Technological College, the college opened in 1925 with six buildings and an enrollment of 914.  Graduate instruction did not begin until 1927 within the school of Liberal Arts. A “Division of Graduate Studies” was established in 1935 and eventually became known as the Graduate School in 1954. By action of the Texas State Legislature, Texas Technological College formally became Texas Tech University on September 1, 1969. A new era of excellence is dawning at Texas Tech University as it stands on the cusp of being one of the nation's premier research institutions. Research and enrollment numbers are at record levels. Texas Tech's total research expenditures topped 140 million in 2012. Fall enrollment for 2013 eclipsed that of the previous fall with 33,111 students. Numbers like that cement Texas Tech's commitment to attracting and retaining quality students. The university strives to foster an environment that celebrates student accomplishment above all else. Texas Tech is large enough to provide the best in facilities and academics, but small enough to focus on each student individually. Quality students need a top-notch faculty. Texas Tech is home to a diverse, highly revered pool of educators who excel in teaching, research and service. In 2013, ten faculty members were awarded grants from the Fulbright U.S. Scholar Program, the most of any research university in the nation. Through the Fulbright program, educators are bestowed the opportunity to work side-by-side with researchers around the world promoting educational collaboration. The momentum for excellence at Texas Tech has never been greater.","http://public.crunchbase.com/t_api_images/v1421565067/snmtyhcgxfy3ybhvyhdp.jpg","http://www.ttu.edu",2014-04-20,2016-02-05,"United States","Lubbock",33.5802,-101.8859

As the first public law school in Southern California and the youngest top-ranked law school in the United States, UCLA Law has consistently pushed new boundaries in the study and practice of law.Beginning in the 1970s, our clinics were among the first to teach students systematically about the link between doctrinal mastery and practical skills. We remain committed to this integration of theory and practice with an extraordinary array of simulated transaction courses and live-client clinics that cover everything from mergers and acquisitions to workers’ rights and environmental law.In the 1990s, UCLA Law created an Empirical Research Group (ERG) so that faculty could incorporate sophisticated data techniques into their research. During this time, the law school also established think tanks where policy and legal issues could be discussed free of partisan influence and ideological biases. These institutes have consistently promoted the highest standards of intellectual discourse. Through research and published articles, our centers offer invaluable information for legislators, the judiciary and the public while providing critical training for UCLA Law students and the legal community.   Over the decades, UCLA Law has developed a depth and breadth of academic offerings unsurpassed by any other law school in the nation. Our Epstein Program in Public Interest Law and Policy is among the best anywhere. We are one of four among the top 20 law schools with a specialization in Business Law and Policy – and the only one to offer a specialization in Critical Race Studies.  UCLA Law’s faculty also has emerged as one of the most influential nationwide. Our professors are leading scholars in areas including bankruptcy, corporate law, constitutional law, critical race theory, entertainment law, environmental law, intellectual property and tax law.Today, the UCLA Law alumni community is more than 15,000 strong and extends around the world. Alumni live and practice in virtually every state, the District of Columbia, multiple U.S. territories and more than 50 foreign nations. These graduates excel in their chosen fields, from private practice to business to government to public interest and beyond. We have a long tradition of distinction on the bench, with more than 320 alumni who are serving, or have served, on courts throughout the country. Six UCLA Law alumni are now judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit – the largest number of graduates from any one law school who are serving on the court.We take pride in these achievements and recognize that the strength of UCLA Law is a direct result of the superlative work of our faculty and staff, the talents of our diverse and academically gifted student body, and the accomplishments and unstinting generosity of our alumni. By building on past successes, UCLA Law continues to propel the school, students, faculty and alumni into a future of unparalleled distinction.","http://public.crunchbase.com/t_api_images/v1453388853/bugrhq2mghnltdeihsg4.png","http://www.law.ucla.edu",2014-04-20,2016-01-22,"United States","Los Angeles",34.05223,34.05223

"universidade-federal-de-minas-gerais","Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais","UFMG is one of Brazil's five largest universities, being the largest federal university.","The origins in Brazil of the university go back as far as the 19th century, when it first appeared in the Republic as a continuation of a process that began during the Empire, with the opening of the first institutions of higher education.In Minas Gerais, the first institution of higher education, the School of Pharmacy in Ouro Preto, was founded in 1839. In 1875, the School of Mining was created and, in 1892, already under the Republican regime, the School of Law was established in the ancient capital of the state.In 1898, when the capital was moved to Belo Horizonte, the School of Law was moved as well. Then, in 1907, the Free School of Dentistry was created and, four years later, the Schools of Medicine and Engineering opened. In 1911, the School of Pharmacy was added to the Free School of Dentistry.A group of patriots, the \"Inconfidentes,\" who rebelled against Portuguese domination, conceived of the idea of a university in the state of Minas Gerais, which was founded as the Universidade de Minas Gerais (UMG) in 1927. The state-subsidized private institution brought together the four institutions of higher learning that existed in Belo Horizonte. UMG remained within the state system until 1949, when it was federalized.In the 1940s, a large area in the Pampulha region became the site for the construction of University City. The first structures erected were the Institute of Mechanics (now the Vocational School) and the Main Building. The effective occupation of the campus by the university community started only in the 1960s, when the construction of the buildings that today house most of the academic units was started.The present name – Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG) – was not adopted until 1965.When the university was federalized, the Schools of Architecture, Philosophy, and Economics had already been integrated into UFMG.Afterward, as part of its expansion and diversification, the university incorporated and created new units and schools: the Schools of Nursing (1950) and Veterinary Medicine (1961), the Minas Gerais Conservatory of Music (1962), and the Schools of Library (1962), Fine Arts (1963), and Physical Education (1969).In 1968, the organization of UFMG was reformed, which resulted in the division of the old School of Philosophy into various schools and institutes. Thus, the present School of Philosophy and Human Sciences, the Institutes of Biological Sciences and Exact Sciences, the Institute of Geo-Sciences, and the Schools of Letters and Education appeared.Today, firmly established as a model of excellence for the rest of the country, UFMG continues to expand. Agronomy (in Montes Claros), Drama, Control and Automation, Computational Mathematics, Audiology and Speech Pathology, and Nutrition have been added in the last five years, bringing the total of courses offered at the undergraduate level to 48.","http://public.crunchbase.com/t_api_images/v1411283966/kodymqhqklj8oozffpwm.jpg","http://www.ufmg.br",2014-04-20,2015-12-18,"Brazil","Belo Horizonte",-19.92083,-19.92083

"university-of-belgrade","University of Belgrade","The origin of the University of Belgrade can be tracked down to the beginning of the 19th century, when Dositej Obradović founded the.......","The origin of the University of Belgrade can be tracked down to the beginning of the 19th century, when Dositej Obradović founded the College in 1808. The University of Belgrade is the leading higher education institution in the region, with a tradition of over two centuries. Founded in 1808, today the University has 31 faculties, 11 scientific research institutes, the University Library and 8 centers within its scope. The Faculties of the University of Belgrade are divided into four scientific groups: the group of faculties of social sciences and humanities, the group of faculties of medical sciences, the group of faculties of sciences and mathematics and, finally, the group of faculties of technology and engineering sciences. Students, both domestic and foreign, have at their disposal 11 student dormitories, numerous restaurants, medical facilities, a sports center, a cultural center, two academic artistic associations and various student organizations. There are approximately 90000 students attending the University of Belgrade (all levels of studies), over 2000 foreign (exchange) students and close to 7000 teaching and administrative staff members. Accredited study programs that are conducted at the University have been harmonized with the principles of the Bologna Declaration, with the aim to make the University of Belgrade a part of the Common European Education Area. In the previous academic year, 133 undergraduate, 112 master and 80 doctoral and specialist study programs were accredited at the University. International cooperation with an emphasis on the mobility of students and teaching staff is one way of achieving the above mentioned aim. This cooperation gives students an excellent opportunity to learn, through the exchange of students, about other countries, languages and cultures, but also to be unique ambassadors of their country abroad. It is crucial to stress that the University of Belgrade is a member of many international associations, such as EUA (European University Association), UNIADRION (Adriatic Sea Region University Association), Danube Rectors’ Conference, Black Sea University Network, and is an active participant in European programs TEMPUS, CEEPUS, ERASMUS MUNDUS, FP7. The quality of teaching and commitment to working with students can easily be recognized through many honors and awards bestowed upon the University of Belgrade. Impressive results achieved by students at prestigious international championships helped to bring back Serbia her just place on the educational map of Europe and the world. Besides competitions in knowledge, we can be proud of many successes of our students at sporting events. After numerous medals won at basketball, volleyball, handball and football competitions, since recently we can also be proud of the rowing team that has proven itself a worthy opponent to the famous Cambridge University rowing eight. The University of Belgrade has extensive cooperation with leading companies which conduct business in Serbia. This cooperation is realized through various forms of strategic collaboration and partnership. A special dedication and support to our graduates’ future careers is shown by the University Center for Career Development, which is an important link between graduates and employers. The Career Center puts special emphasis on raising awareness of students and graduates about present day business and market conditions and challenges. With that in mind, a special University internship program was established last year, when a Protocol on Cooperation was signed between the University of Belgrade and the City Administration of the City of Belgrade. The Protocol gave our students a unique opportunity to conduct internship in public utility companies and public enterprises in the City of Belgrade. During the two centuries of its existence the University of Belgrade has served its people, and its former students and teachers have greatly contributed towards the development of cultural, scientific, educational, political and economical life of our country. The University of Belgrade is prepared to maintain and improve its position as the leading higher education institution both in the country and in the region, by preserving what is worthy in its tradition and also by adapting to the challenges of the present day.","http://public.crunchbase.com/t_api_images/v1434381956/bwrnb47wyezmneqhylkv.png","http://www.bg.ac.rs/en/",2014-04-20,2015-12-20,"Serbia","Belgrade",44.80401,44.80401

An emphasis is placed on an interdisciplinary approach, with close cooperation between students, teaching staff, and professors. The Academy, the forerunner of the UNIL, was founded in 1537. Its vocation at that time was to train ministers for the church. The university enjoyed a certain renown due to the fact that it was the only French-language Protestant school of theology. As the centuries passed, the number of faculties increased and diversified until, in 1890, the Academy received the name and status of a university. In 1970, the university moved progressively from the old city of Lausanne, around the Cathedral and the Château, to its present site at Dorigny. The end of the 20th century witnessed the beginnings of an ambitious project aiming at greater co-operation and development among the French-speaking universities of Lausanne, Geneva and Neuchâtel, together with the EPFL. In 2003, two new faculties were founded concentrating on life and human sciences: the Faculty of Biology and Medicine; and the Faculty of Geosciences and Environment.","http://public.crunchbase.com/t_api_images/v1429368845/flbyrxbloouereyvmskx.jpg","http://www.unil.ch/central/en/home.html",2014-04-20,2016-02-04,"Switzerland","Lausanne",46.516,46.516

It was established on 8th October 1949 in Singapore with the merger of the King Edward VII College of Medicine (founded in 1905) and Raffles College (founded in 1928). University of Malaya (UM) is the foremost and premier Research University in Malaysia. It is a multidisciplinary RU that has more than 23,000 students and 2,000 academic staff with 17 faculties and research centres that covers the whole spectrum of learning from the Arts, Sciences and Humanities. The university's beginning at the Kuala Lumpur campus dates back to 1959 and thus far has a huge alumni of over 100,000, among them renowned and illustrious personalities and leaders in various fields. The University of Malaya derives its name from the term 'Malaya' as the country was then known. The Carr-Saunders Commission on University Education in Malaya, which recommended the setting up of the university, noted in its Report in 1948: \"The University of Malaya would provide for the first time a common centre where varieties of race, religion and economic interest could mingle in joint endeavour ... For a University of Malaya must inevitably realise that it is a university for Malaya.\" The growth of the University was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and this resulted in the setting up of two autonomous Divisions on 15 January 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur. In 1960, the government of the two territories indicated their desire to change the status of the Divisions into that of a national university. Legislation was passed in 1961 and the University of Malaya was established on 1st January 1962. On June 16th 1962, University of Malaya celebrated the installation of its first Chancellor, Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj, who was also the country's first prime minister. The first Vice-Chancellor was Professor Oppenheim, a world-renowned Mathematician. Currently, His Royal Highness The Sultan of Perak Darul Ridzuan, Sultan Nazrin Muizzuddin Shah is the Chancellor of the University of Malaya. Professor Dato' Dr. Mohd Amin Jalaludin was appointed as the eleventh Vice-Chancellor of University of Malaya on 8th November 2013.","http://public.crunchbase.com/t_api_images/v1436528681/y9u2bwhmmgc9xrxhkogr.png","http://www.um.edu.my",2014-04-20,2016-02-01,"Malaysia","Kuala Lumpur",3.1412,3.1412

Affiliated with 7 Nobel laureates, it has produced 5 NASA astronauts, 7 Marshall scholars, 4 Churchill scholars, 29 Truman scholars, and 50 Rhodes scholars.Thomas Jefferson founded the University of Virginia in 1819. He wished the publicly-supported school to have a national character and stature. It is the first non-sectarian university in the United States and the first to use the elective course system.Jefferson considered the founding of the university to be one of his greatest achievements. Undertaking the project toward the end of his life after a long and illustrious career that included serving as a colonial revolutionary, political leader, writer, architect, inventor, and horticulturalist, he was closely involved in the university's design. He planned the curriculum, recruited the first faculty, and designed the Academical Village, a terraced green space surrounded by residential and academic buildings, gardens, and the majestic center-point, the Rotunda. The most recognizable symbol of the university, the Rotunda stands at the north end of the Lawn and is half the height and width of the Pantheon in Rome which was the primary inspiration for the building. The Lawn and the Rotunda have served as models for similar designs of centralized green areas at universities across the United States.The university was opened for classes in 1825 with a faculty of eight and a student body numbering sixty-eight. Jefferson took great pains to recruit the most highly qualified faculty, five of whom were found in England and three in the United States. Instructions were offered in ancient languages, modern languages, mathematics, moral philosophy, natural philosophy, chemistry, law, and medicine.Jefferson opposed the granting of degrees on the grounds that they were ‘artificial embellishments’. In 1824, however, the Board of Visitors authorized granting the Master of Arts degree. The Doctor of Medicine or M.D. was awarded to the first graduates of the School of Medicine in 1828 and the Bachelor of Law degree or LL.B. was first awarded for law school graduates in 1842. The bachelor's degree was awarded beginning in 1849, but became the standard undergraduate degree and a prerequisite for the master's degree in 1899 bringing the university into conformity with other institutions of higher learning. The PhD has been awarded since 1883.","http://public.crunchbase.com/t_api_images/v1452074858/zylckjz7khckuwodmkka.jpg","http://www.virginia.edu/",2014-04-20,2016-02-05,"United States","Charlottesville",38.0329,-78.5057

In 1991, the institution became the Polytechnic of West London, before gaining full university status in 1992 to become Thames Valley University.

One year later, WU was one of the first universities to join the CEMS network (Community of European Management Schools and International Companies).In two steps, one in 1993 and a major one in 2004, WU gained autonomy from the Austrian Ministry for Education, Science and Culture. The university started a major strategic planning process.Since October 2005, WU has been systematically replacing all its first-degree (Magister) programs with Bachelor's and Master's programs. With this, WU is adopting the three-cycle system promoted by the Bologna process.In 2007, WU became the first Austrian University to receive the international EQUIS accreditation.
